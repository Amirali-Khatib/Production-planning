# Production-planning
I've done 2 main projects in the course.
1. Implementation of dynamic programming algorithms to recognize the best time for production. In each selected optimal time you should satisfy customers' demand at a specific time interval. (e.g. your model chooses to manufacture in t = 2 to meet the predicted demand within the time interval of t~[0,3])
2. Farm problem (using Lingo for our optimization problem)


**Note**: The attached description file in the dynamic programming folder, which is split from Dr.Ranjbar's slides, I implemented the 2nd type of optimization problem.
