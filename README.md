# Production-planning
I've done 2 main projects in the course.
1. Implementation of dynamic programming algorithms to recognize the best time for production. In each selected optimal time you should satisfy the demand of customers at a specific time interval. (e.g. your model chooses to manufacture in t = 2 to satisfy the predicted demand within the time interval of t~[0,3])
2. Farm problem (using Lingo for our optimization problem)
